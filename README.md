#git refresher

Hi! I'm looking to colaborate more with other creators so I thought I should brush up on my git knowledge. I've been working a lot with python/ Flask lately. In the past I've done projects in Java and some scripting, mostly in powershell and bash. I've recently purchased a 3d printer. In addition to storing .stl files, I'd also like to work on modifying firmware to add funtionality. Hopefully we can work together and create something cool!
